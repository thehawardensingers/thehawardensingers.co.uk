					<p><h3>Malcolm Williams - Musical Director</h3>
					Malcolm was born in North Wales, in the small town of Flint, and began his musical career under the baton of Sir Benjamin Britten, singing treble at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester. Since those heady long gone days he has gained much experience in Opera, Oratorio, so-called 'Light' Music and Recital work. A pupil of local teacher Colin Jones he has also received tuition under John Huw Davies, Jean Allister, Duncan Robertson and Ian Humphris at the Charterhouse Summer School of Music. Having been a member of the Hawarden Singers tenor section in the past he was also principal tenor soloist during their visit to Toulouse in 2000. Malcolm brings to rehearsals a wealth of musical knowledge, enthusiasm and expertise and also some appalling jokes! He has exciting plans for the future of the choir.</p>

					<h3>Margaret Williams - Accompanist</h3>	
					<p>Our modest multi-talented accompanist, Margaret is by profession a mathematician. Born in Prestatyn, then moving back to Mold after living in Talybont near Aberystwyth, Margaret attended Maes Garmon and Mold Alun secondary schools in Mold. At the age of seven Margaret first started her piano lessons and later added the cello to her accomplishments. She has played the cello with the Clwyd Chamber Orchestra and accompanied various soloists on the piano. Since her working life has been devoted to research and IT, Margaret has always considered her music as "just a hobby". She has also accompanied three choirs; the Cantorian Glan Alun Mixed Voice Choir, the Caerwys Male Voice Choir and our own Hawarden Singers and just recently she has started playing the organ at her local chapel in Lixwm. In 2008 the Hawarden Singers were very fortunate to welcome Margaret as their accompanist. </p>
